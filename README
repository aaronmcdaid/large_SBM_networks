This is part of my SBM project. See https://sites.google.com/site/aaronmcdaid/sbm

The data files used in our paper [2] in section 6.3 ("Larger networks") are very large.
So I have created this Makefile to generate the data locally, and optionally to run our SBM code
on it. The source code for our algorithm is also online [1].


	@echo "Three commands, to be run in order:"
	@echo "   make generate_data # using the commands in parameters.txt to create folders with synthetic networks in them"
	@echo "   make run_sbm       # for each folder that is specified in parameters.txt, run the SBM for 10,000 iterations."
	@echo "   make make_table    # print the runtime and number of iterations until the correct result is reached."
